# Final Project - Causal Inference (097400)

Social networks became a major part of our day-to-day life. Besides their use for socializing, social networks are also used for advertising and promotions of products, companies, events, etc. Product growth and marketing analysts in companies often try to optimize their internet campaigns via various parameters such as content, publishing time, design, audience and many more. Note that not only companies care about this type of optimization, but also many users take those considerations into account when posting. As such, optimizing social networks engagement became a point of interest for many users, both individuals and business companies. 

In this project our scope will be limited to Twitter data. We will focus on identifying and estimating the causal effect of tweets publication time on users’ engagement and tweet popularity. Specifically, we will look at the hour-of-day as the treatment and at a measure of engagement/ popularity (e.g., relative number of likes, retweets, etc.) as the outcome.

We aim to identify the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) of tweets publication time on tweet popularity, in two levels of granularity. The first level will be by conditioning only on the tweets’ domains, and the second level will be by conditioning on high-dimensional covariate vector, including the tweets’ domains, text, user features, etc. Understanding the causal effect of publication hours on tweets’ popularity in different granularity levels may enable publication time optimization by users or companies seeking to increase engagement.
